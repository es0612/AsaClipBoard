# Task Completion Checklist

## When Completing Development Tasks

### 1. Code Quality Checks
- [ ] All code follows project style conventions
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Code is well-documented with meaningful comments

### 2. Testing Requirements
- [ ] All tests pass using SwiftTesting framework
- [ ] New functionality has corresponding tests
- [ ] Tests follow TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- [ ] Test coverage is adequate for the feature
- [ ] Tests are meaningful and test actual behavior

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Test individual packages first (faster feedback)
cd ClipboardSecurity && swift test
cd ClipboardCore && swift test
cd ClipboardUI && swift test

# Build main project
xcodebuild -project AsaClipBoard.xcodeproj -scheme AsaClipBoard -destination 'platform=macOS' build

# Run full test suite
xcodebuild test -project AsaClipBoard.xcodeproj -scheme AsaClipBoard -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

### 4. Package Dependencies
- [ ] All SPM dependencies resolved correctly
- [ ] No circular dependencies between packages
- [ ] External dependencies are pinned to stable versions
- [ ] Package.swift files are properly configured

### 5. XcodeGen Configuration
- [ ] project.yml is updated if new targets/dependencies added
- [ ] Regenerate Xcode project: `xcodegen generate`
- [ ] Verify project builds after regeneration

### 6. Kiro Spec Compliance
- [ ] Task marked as completed in tasks.md: `- [x] Task description`
- [ ] Implementation matches design specification
- [ ] All acceptance criteria from requirements are met
- [ ] Update spec status: `/kiro:spec-status [feature]`

### 7. Security and Privacy
- [ ] No sensitive data logged or exposed

- [ ] Update README.md if user-facing changes
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if development process changes

### 10. Final Verification
- [ ] Feature works as expected in practice
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Ready for next development phase
